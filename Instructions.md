# GETTING STARTED

- `cd` to `frontend/`
- run `yarn install`

**Make sure the backend server is running**

- run `yarn start` to start the frontend server
- To get eslint linting on your files, you must open `frontend/` through vscode, then vscode will have the lint running.

# Structure

- `index.js` is the "index" and renders the root component
- `App.js` has the "App" which is the root component
- `App.js` has a basic [React Grid](https://devexpress.github.io/devextreme-reactive/react/grid/docs/guides/fundamentals/) setup for now
